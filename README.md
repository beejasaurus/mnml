# mnml

mnml is a theme for deck.js, a JavaScript library for building modern HTML presentations. It is a (very) customized version of the "Swiss" default theme.

## Usage

1. Download the repository either as an archive or via git.

2. Copy `mnml.css` to your CSS folder and add it as a stylesheet to your presentation:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="/path/to/mnml.css" />
```

That's it! Fire up a browser and give a presentation for *acutal* profit!
